# LLM Inference Overview

Here you can find the inference benchmarking scripts for large language models (LLM) text generation. These scripts:

- Support Llama 2, GPT-J, Qwen, OPT, Bloom model families and some other Chinese models such as ChatGLMv3-6B and Baichuan2-13B. 
- Include both single instance and distributed (DeepSpeed) use cases for FP16 optimization.
- Cover model generation inference with low precision cases for different models with best performance and accuracy (fp16 AMP and weight only quantization)


## Optimized Models

Currently, only support Transformers 4.31.0. Support for newer versions of Transformers and more models will be available in the future.

- ðŸŸ© signifies that it is supported.

- ðŸŸ¥ signifies that it is not supported yet.


**Note**: The verified models mentioned above (including other models in the same model family, like "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf" from LLAMA family) are well-supported with all optimizations like indirect access KV cache and fused ROPE. For other LLM families, we are actively working to implement these optimizations, which will be reflected in the expanded model list above. 

## Supported Platforms

\* IntelÂ® Data Center GPU Max Series (1550/1100) and Optimized on IntelÂ® Arcâ„¢ A-Series Graphics (A770) : support all the models in the model list above.<br />

|---|:---:|:---:|
|Single instance | ðŸŸ© | ðŸŸ© |
| Distributed (autotp) |  ðŸŸ© | ðŸŸ¥ |

- ðŸŸ© signifies that it is supported.

Note: During the execution, you may need to log in your Hugging Face account to access model files. Refer to [HuggingFace Login](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#login)

### Run with Bash Script

Run all inference cases with the one-click bash script `run_benchmark.sh`:
```
bash run_benchmark.sh
```

#### Single Instance Performance

Note: We only support LLM optimizations with datatype float16, so please don't change datatype to float32 or bfloat16.

```bash
# fp16 benchmark
python -u run_generation.py --benchmark -m ${model} --num-beams ${beam} --num-iter ${iter} --batch-size ${bs} --input-tokens ${input} --max-new-tokens ${output} --device xpu --ipex --dtype float16 --token-latency
```

**Note**: By default, generations are based on `bs = 1`, input token size = 1024, output toke size = 128, iteration num = 10 and `beam search`, and beam size = 4. For beam size = 1 and other settings, please export env settings, such as: `beam=1`, `input=32`, `output=32`, `iter=5`.

#### Distributed Performance with DeepSpeed

For all distributed inference cases, run LLM with the one-click bash script `run_benchmark_ds.sh`:
```
bash run_benchmark_ds.sh
```

```bash
# fp16 benchmark
mpirun -np 2 --prepend-rank python -u run_generation_with_deepspeed.py --benchmark -m ${model} --num-beams ${beam} --num-iter ${iter} --batch-size ${bs} --input-tokens ${input} --max-new-tokens ${output} --device xpu --ipex --dtype float16 --token-latency
```

**Note**: By default, generations are based on `bs = 1`, input token size = 1024, output toke size = 128, iteration num = 10 and `beam search`, and beam size = 4. For beam size = 1 and other settings, please export env settings, such as: `beam=1`, `input=32`, `output=32`, `iter=5`.

## Advanced Usage


### Single Instance Accuracy

```bash
Accuracy test {TASK_NAME}, choice in this [link](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/master/docs/task_table.md), by default we use "lambada_standard"

# one-click bash script
bash run_accuracy.sh

# float16
LLM_ACC_TEST=1 python -u run_generation.py -m ${model} --ipex --dtype float16 --accuracy-only --acc-tasks ${task}
```

### Distributed Accuracy with DeepSpeed

```bash
# one-click bash script
bash run_accuracy_ds.sh

# float16
LLM_ACC_TEST=1 mpirun -np 2 --prepend-rank python -u run_generation_with_deepspeed.py -m ${model} --ipex --dtype float16 --accuracy-only --acc-tasks ${task} 2>&1
```


### Weight Only Quantization with low precision checkpoint (Prototype)

Using INT4 weights can further improve performance by reducing memory bandwidth. However, direct per-channel quantization of weights to INT4 may result in poor accuracy. Some algorithms can modify weights through calibration before quantizing weights to minimize accuracy drop. You may generate modified weights and quantization info (scales, zero points) for a Llama 2/GPT-J/Qwen models with a dataset for specified tasks by such algorithms. We recommend intel extension for transformer to quantize the LLM model.

Check [WOQ INT4](../../../../../docs/tutorials/llm/int4_weight_only_quantization.md) for more details.

#### Install intel-extension-for-transformers and intel-neural-compressor 

```
pip install neural-compressor
pip install intel-extension-for-transformers
```

#### Install other required packages


```
pip install tiktoken einops transformers_stream_generator
```

#### Run the weight only quantization and inference

```python
bash run_benchmark_woq.sh
```

>Note:
> * Saving quantized model should be executed before the optimize_transformers function is called.
> * The optimize_transformers function is designed to optimize transformer-based models within frontend Python modules, with a particular focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides optimizations for both model-wise and content-generation-wise. The detail of `optimize_transformers`, please refer to [Transformers Optimization Frontend API](../../../../../docs/tutorials/llm/llm_optimize_transformers.md).
